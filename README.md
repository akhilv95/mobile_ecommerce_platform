# mobile_ecommerce_platform
This project is a responsive e-commerce website built with React, designed to display a selection of mobile phone products and allow users to add items to their cart, view details, and complete the checkout process. The project uses components for product listings, navigation, and a cart that summarizes selected items and total costs.
